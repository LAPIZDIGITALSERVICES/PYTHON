How do I run a Python program under Windows?

Python does not pre-installed with Windows. 
It needs to be manually downloaded and installed. 
You can get Python from the following: http://python.org/download/

Simply download the Python installer and follow the instructions. 
Make sure to remember the directory you used to install Python. 
You may need this information at the top of each of your Python scripts depending on 
what type of environment you are using to execute the scripts.


Steps to execute scripts.

1. Launch command prompt from windows.
2. Run your code and you'll be put into the Python debugger, where you can use sEnter to step through the code.
